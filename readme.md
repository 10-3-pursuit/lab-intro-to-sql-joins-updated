# Lab SQL Table Joins

<img src="./assets/d-join.webp" width="400" height="400">

This is an exercise wher you will practice using JOINS.

You need to track certain data for your business based on the orders that have been made from your customers.

## Getting Started

In the terminal run the following commands:

- `fork` and `clone` this repository
- `cd` into to directory
- `ls` make sure you see the file regifter.sql
- `psql`
- `\i customers.sql` to run the file customers.sql

Each time that you run the final command you are recreating the database and the tables.

To test a query, each time, run `\i customers.sql`

If you feel your terminal is too crowded when testing, feel free to comment out the previous problems.
**DO NOT** comment out the statements and solutions between `Getting started, do not update` and `\echo - Find all orders, including the firstname, lastname and email of the customer who made each order.`

There is a prompt for each SQL command you should write. `\echo will print the instructions out in the console.
